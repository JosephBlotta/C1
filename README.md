1. Project: Add Website and Files to Github
   
Goals

By the end of this lesson you will:

Upload and host your site on GitHub
Add pages and CSS/SCSS
Collaborate on other projects

Introduction

In the previous modules and exercises we created file paths, file structures, linked HTML pages together, filled them with SEO details and then we learnt how to use Git and GitHub with their different commands while also learning how to create repositories. Now we will learn to upload our website from our local machine to GitHub, add pages, CSS/SCSS and collaborate on projects.
Note: You can use the previous files you created for building your website.

1.  Create your personal website with the correct file structure on your local machine - this file structure should include:
      a. One index.html page - this page should contain meta tags and all the HTML document linked appropriately
      b. At least three other pages you can link to ( you can use the ones from the previous exercise: about us, contact us, and products page)
      c. One CSS file and one optional Javascript file
      d. At least two images on any page of your choice
  
2.  Upload and host your website to GitHub - name the repository after your websiteâ€™s name

3.  Add one more additional page

4.  Change the color and bold a sentence on any page using pull and merge commands

5.  Invite collaborators through their GitHub username
